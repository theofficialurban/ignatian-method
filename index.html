    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Amber (Dark) -->
    <!-- 
      Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard with three distinct but interconnected views: "Military Parallels," "Psychological Conditioning," and "Operational Tactics." This structure was chosen to create a comprehensive narrative. Users can first understand the abstract model (Military), then see how the individual is forged (Psychological), and finally explore how that individual is deployed in the world (Operational). This non-linear, thematic approach allows users to compare the internal programming (Spiritual Exercises) with the external strategy (Secret Instructions), making the report's complex arguments more digestible and impactful.
    -->
    <!-- 
      Visualization & Content Choices: 
      - Report Info: Parallels to Military Discipline -> Goal: Compare thematic concepts -> Viz: Interactive Cards -> Interaction: Click to reveal detailed text -> Justification: Allows users to focus on one abstract concept at a time.
      - Report Info: Phased Psychological Conditioning (Four Weeks) -> Goal: Show change over time/process -> Viz: Timeline + Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Clicking a phase on the timeline updates both text and the chart -> Justification: Visually represents the abstract psychological dynamics (distress vs. adherence) over the four phases.
      - Report Info: The Secret Instructions of the Jesuits -> Goal: Expose strategic methods -> Viz: Interactive Cards -> Interaction: Click to reveal specific manipulative tactics -> Justification: Thematically groups the various deceptive strategies (Infiltration, Wealth Acquisition, etc.) for clear, focused exploration of the operational manual.
      - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

This figure is not a passive counselor but an active commander who modifies exercises, manages the exercitant's emotional state, and acts as the sole arbiter of reality.
